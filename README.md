# Web Application Security Vulnerabilities Report
This repository documents the practical steps I took to explore and exploit web application vulnerabilities in a controlled environment using the **OWASP Juice Shop**. The aim is to demonstrate my understanding of **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** while highlighting the importance of securing web applications against these attacks.

## Vulnerabilities Exploited
**1. SQL Injection (SQLi)**

I successfully injected malicious SQL code into a vulnerable login form to bypass authentication.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

I exploited the feedback/comment form to inject malicious JavaScript and demonstrate client-side script execution.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains:

  - Detailed explanations of the vulnerabilities exploited.
  - Step-by-step instructions to perform the attacks.
  - Screenshots of the attack process and results.
  - Mitigation techniques to prevent these vulnerabilities.

## Lessons Learned

**1. SQL Injection:**

  - A single vulnerable input field can compromise an entire application.
  - Validating and sanitizing user inputs is critical.

**2. XSS:**

 - Improperly escaped user inputs can execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
 - Content Security Policies (CSP) and input sanitization are effective countermeasures.

## Important Notes

**1. Ethical Practices Only:**

  - These attacks were performed in a controlled environment using the OWASP Juice Shop.
  - Never attempt such attacks on live systems without proper authorization.

**2. Purpose:**

  - This project is purely for educational purposes and aims to raise awareness about web security.

## Tools Used

  - **OWASP Juice Shop:**
   
    A deliberately vulnerable web application.

  - **Browser Developer Tools:**
    
    To test and inject payloads.

## Conclusion

By successfully performing SQL Injection and XSS attacks, I gained a deeper understanding of web vulnerabilities and the need for secure coding practices. This repository showcases my ability to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them in a controlled environment, and propose appropriate mitigation techniques.
